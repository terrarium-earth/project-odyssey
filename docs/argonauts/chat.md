# Chat Screen

Argonauts features a chat screen for privately chatting with guild/party members. The screen displays all members along with how many are online.
Chat messages can be up to 512 characters in length, and also feature custom embeds for certain links. These embeds are:
- Images. Displays the image when hovered over the link. Supported image hosts are:
  - Imgur (i.imgur.com)
  - Tenor (media.tenor.com)
  - Discord (media.discordapp.net | cdn.discordapp.com)
- Videos. Displays the video thumbnail when hovered over the link. Supported video hosts are:
  - YouTube (youtube.com | youtu.be)
- Music. Displays the song and album art when hovered over the link. Supported Music hosts are:
  - Spotify (open.spotify.com)

Chats are not persistent between server restarts, so you will lose your chat history when the server restarts. For admins, it will still be logged in the console.
For parties, it's `(Argonauts Chat) [PARTY] <message>` and for guilds, it's `(Argonauts Chat) [GUILD] <message>`.
