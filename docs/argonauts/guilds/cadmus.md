# Cadmus Integration

By default, Cadmus uses the vanilla team system. With Argonauts installed, Cadmus will use Argonauts' guild system instead.
This means that you and your guild members will be able to share the same claims. Your settings, such as name and color, will also
be displayed on the claim map.

An additional permission is also available in the guild members menu called `Temporary Guild Permissions`. This is
an alliance system of sorts. When a guild member is granted this permission, and they lead a party, the members in that player's
party will bypass claim protections within the guild's claims. The party leader is then able to set which types of claim protections 
are bypassed in the party members menu.
