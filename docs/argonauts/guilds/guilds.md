# Guilds

Guilds are a more permanent form of team. They are persistent across logins and feature role management, setting headquarters, 
displaying messages of the day, and more. Guilds also integrate with Cadmus for chunk claiming as a team, and Heracles for completing quests together.

Guilds are created by using the `/guild create` command.
