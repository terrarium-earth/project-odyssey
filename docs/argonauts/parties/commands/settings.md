# Settings Commands

## Settings Command

```text
/party settings
```

Opens the party settings screen. The settings screen has the following options:
- `Public Party`: Allows anyone to join without an invite.
- `Friendly Fire`: Allows party members to damage each other.
- `Passive Teleport`: Allows party members to teleport to each other.
Requires the `Manage Settings`: Permission.

```text
/party settings <setting> <value>
```

If Argonauts is only installed on the server, you can still manage party settings via commands instead of the GUI. This command features a game rule-esque syntax.
You can check the current value by running the command without specifying a value.
