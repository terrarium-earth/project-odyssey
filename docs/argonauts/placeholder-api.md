# Placeholder API Integration (Fabric)

Argonauts supports [Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api) on the Fabric mod loader.
Argonauts adds two placeholders:
- `%argonauts:party%` the name of the party the player is in.
- `%argonauts:guild%` the name of the guild the player is in.

In addition, guild message of the day messages support Placeholder API, allowing you to use placeholders within the message.
