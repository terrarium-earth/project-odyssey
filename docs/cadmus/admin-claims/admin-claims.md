# Admin Claims

Admin claims are specialized claims that do not belong to a team or player. 
They feature a region flag system that allows for fine-grained control over who can do what within the claim.
Admin claim groups are created with the `/cadmus adminclaims create` command. 
Flags are managed per admin claim group with the `/cadmus adminclaims flag` commands.
