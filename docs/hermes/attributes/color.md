# Hermes Attribute: `color`

The `color` attribute is used in a variety of elements to change the color of parts of the element.
The color can come in multiple forms, including hashed hexadecimal, hexadecimal, and named colors.
Named colors are the same as those used in CSS along with the `rainbow` color which will slowly cycle
through colors.

## Examples

Hashed Hexadecimal example

```html
<blockquote color="#ff0000">
    <p>Line 1</p>
    <p>Line 2</p>
    <p>Line 3</p>
</blockquote>
```

Hexadecimal example

```html
<blockquote color="0xff0000">
    <p>Line 1</p>

```

<blockquote color="red">
    <p>Line 1</p>
